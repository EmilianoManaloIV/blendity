# Changelog

One entry per round of requests, newest first: what was asked, what changed, and how it was checked. Earlier rounds are summarised from their commits.

## 2026-10-08 (round 10): materials as assets, drawing tools, UModeler tools, origin fix

**Asked:** push the previous round; keep a changelog; Shift + scale on a face makes a new face, as in Blender; automatic seams from sharp edges; a light "focus" like the camera's; UModeler features Blendity lacks; Unity-style material assets you drag onto objects and slots; removing material slots; a polyline tool for circles, arcs and so on, drawn onto a mesh with snapping; fix the origin not being used as the transform point.

**Fixed**
- **Origin as the transform point.** The toolbar's handle position defaulted to *Center*: the gizmo sat at the bounds centre and rotations turned about it, while scaling still used the origin, so a moved origin seemed to do nothing. It now defaults to *Pivot* (the origin, as Blender transforms one object), the choice is saved, and Center scales about the same point it rotates about; G / R / S follow the same setting.
- The "Blender Transform Keys" preference was never saved (it was missing from the preferences file).

**Added**
- **Shift + drag** a gizmo handle in Edit Mode extrudes first: faces get walls and a new cap, so Shift + scale makes an inset face and Shift + move an extrusion (Blender's E then S, ProBuilder / UModeler's Shift-drag). In vertex / edge mode the edges grow faces.
- **Seams from Sharp Edges** (UV menu, UV Editor, edge-mode tools): a seam on every edge whose faces meet at more than the Sharp Angle (30 degrees, Blender's default) and on edges marked sharp; *+ Unwrap* does both. **Select Sharp Edges** too.
- **Light aiming**: Light > *Aim at Point* is an eyedropper like the camera's focus picker. Click a surface and spot, area and directional lights turn to shine at it (X kept level, Unity's LookAt); the range grows to reach it. `pickfocus` and `aimlight x y z` in the console.
- **Material assets** (Unity): Assets > Create Material, or a slot's *Save as Material Asset*, writes `Assets/Materials/<name>.mat`. Drag one from the Project window onto an object in the Scene view (the face under the mouse picks the slot), onto a face in Edit Mode (all selected faces if it is one of them), onto a Hierarchy row or onto an Inspector slot. Images drag onto a material's texture fields. Selecting a `.mat` shows its full material editor; every renderer using it shares one instance, edits are written back to the file, and scenes refer to the file (the values are kept as a fallback).
- **Material slots**: an x on each slot removes it (its faces move to the slot before, as in Blender), plus **Remove Unused Slots**.
- **Drawing tools** (UModeler / SketchUp): Polyline, Rectangle, Circle, Arc and Polygon, drawn onto the edited mesh or the ground (Inspector > Draw, Mesh > Draw, `draw <shape>`). Snapping to corners (green), midpoints (cyan), edges (red), faces (blue) and the ground, with Ctrl for the grid and Shift for the plane's axes, plus a live length. A closed shape inside a face is cut into it, ready for Push/Pull; a line between points on a face's edges splits it through every bend; anything else becomes a new face or wire edges. With nothing selected it starts a new mesh.
- **From UModeler**: **Follow** (sweep a face along a drawn path, SketchUp's Follow Me, with mitred corners), **Spin / Lathe** (edges or vertices turned round an axis), **Slice** (cut by an X / Y / Z or view plane through the selection, optionally removing a side; Blender's Bisect), **Reset XForm** (bake rotation and scale into the mesh), **Mirror** (applied, welded), **Select Similar** (normal, area) and **Select by Material**.

**Checked:** 1005 unit checks on Windows and 981 on Linux, 0 failed (new tests: Shift-drag extrude, seams, light aiming, material assets with save / load and slot removal, drawing on a face and on the ground, Follow / Spin / Slice, Reset XForm and the pivot). The stress suite ran 4,728 operations of the new and existing tools on 26 awkward meshes, plus 390 random shapes, with 0 problems; the editor fuzzer ran 1,500 frames with no crash.

## 2026-10-08 (round 9): every Blender export format, file dialogs, Boolean, modifier stack, shapes, n-gons

**Asked:** Blender's export options and formats (tested against an installed Blender); Save As dialogs for objects and screenshots; origin handles; Boolean operations; combining meshes; parametric objects; SketchUp-style n-gon editing; extruding vertices and edges; a Blender-style modifier stack.

**Added:** export to OBJ, binary / ASCII FBX, glTF (.glb / .gltf), STL, PLY and USD (.usda) with Blender's options, and import of the same; every format checked both ways in Blender 5.2 (this found that the earlier ASCII FBX did not open in Blender). Native Save / Open dialogs. Join, Separate, Boolean (applied or a live modifier with a wire cutter). Wire edges and vertex / edge extrusion. Edit Origin with handles and click snapping. A modifier stack with Edit Mode / Viewport / Render toggles and Bevel, Weld, Triangulate, Wireframe, Displace, Simple Deform, Cast and Screw. Thirteen parametric shapes. N-gon Mode, Merge Coplanar and the Knife (K).

**Checked:** 963 checks on Windows, 939 on Linux; a new stress section with 0 problems.

## 2026-10-08 (round 8): lights, export, selection fixes

Spot and Area lights with colour temperature (rasterizer and CPU / GPU path tracing); OBJ and FBX export; editing another mesh by clicking it in Edit Mode; the Hierarchy's create menu; Alt+click loops and Ctrl+Alt+click rings; the scene gizmo's views; origin dots; a lockable Camera Preview; a camera focus eyedropper; old app builds removed.

## 2026-10-08 (round 7): Blender's modal editing, edge selection, per-face shading

G / R / S modal transforms with axis locks and typed values; edge mode keeps the picked edges; per-face Shade Smooth / Flat and Mark Sharp; Bevel Clamp Overlap and a dozen more Blender operators; Unity-style colour fields; render resolution presets; docs/USABILITY.md.

## 2026-10-07 (rounds 4-6): GPU rendering, Push/Pull, physical cameras

Vulkan GPU path tracing with ray tracing hardware and combined CPU + GPU rendering; SketchUp-style Push/Pull as a confirmed operator, hardened by a stress test on awkward meshes; tools split by selection mode; Set Origin; physical cameras with depth of field and exposure; edge tools (Bevel, Bridge, Push Through); Adjust Last Operation (F9); Inspector expressions and multi-object editing; surface types (opaque, cutout, transparent, glass).

## 2026-10-06 / 07 (rounds 1-3): Blendity

The editor itself: Blender's mesh model and Edit Mode behind a Unity-style editor; UV unwrapping, materials and textures; a deferred rasterizer and a path tracer; Blender's bundled libraries (Embree, OpenImageDenoise, OpenSubdiv, OpenColorIO, Manifold, Jolt and others), each optional; SIMD kernels; the Learn tab; stress tests.
